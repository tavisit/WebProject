# WebProject
This repository was created to organize the code and the information related to the project

## Tehnologies
* FrontEnd: HTML and CSS
* BackEnd: Javascript and NodeJs Framework

## Timeline
* The team was made up of three high-school students: [tavisit](https://github.com/tavisit), [sergiu1sergiu](https://github.com/sergiu1sergiu) and [VlaDutza](https://github.com/VlaDutza)
* Monday night was the brainstorming time which was very unusual, but useful. From around 3000 ideas, we chose somewhere around 10 features to become our site pillars
* Tuesday and Wednesday marked our coding sessions where we implemented ideas from experience, courses and, of course, internet( a lot of it)
* Wednesday night represented the commenting period of our code
* Thursday morning was the time for a short revision of everything and at around 2pm that day, the project was submited to the contest

## Main Details
##### What is this project?
This site is a mini project targeted to simulate the main features of [Emag](www.emag.ro). 

##### Main Pages
* Home Page
* Contacts Page
* Categories Page
* Product Pages( 15 at this moment)

##### Local Server
The code has also a localhost server in NodeJS in order to simulate a realistic environment for web development implemented in two parts.
The first part is the actual creation of the site host realized in **main.js** and the second is the URL interpreter, **router.js**


## Commenting
The whole project is commented in blocks of code. Each main area is discussed in one to three lines of comments for a more readable code with a high level of maintainability

## ToDo list
* Comments + Rating for the products
* Dinamic product pages
* More products
